<h2>Smart device/wearable and machine learning alone do not solve the problem: discussing how integrating environmental sensors to smartphones/wearables could have new applications and add to the currently available biomonitoring data</h2>

<p>The PM2.5, PM10, and the Air Quality index (AQI) are measurable parameters for air pollution. The weather app on our mobile phones shows the AQI, because it is believed that the air quality both outdoor and indoor is of significant importance to our health. Air pollution is a major cause of many premature deaths and severe respiratory illness, especially in children.</p>

<p>There are sensors commercially available that can be used to monitor the air quality around the clock. Many countries are using them to track air pollution levels. Since air pollution has harmful effects on our health, it is an essential matter to public health safety. Expensive instruments that measure air quality are typically installed at different sites to measure air pollution levels within cities, with special focus on industrial sites. Recently it was also shown that cheap optical sensors could be effectively used to some degree in the real time monitoring of air quality in the environment. They can be easily installed in remote areas, in abundant quantities, essentially everywhere, and require low operational costs. These sensors can provide big data and can keep us informed about the air quality changes in many areas.</p> 

<p>However, information about the air quality in the local environment of individuals remains largely inaccessible. This information could give the users useful predictions about when to go for outdoor sport activities, as an example. I expect in the future that smaller sensors will be integrated into mobile devices. When this becomes a standard for the smart device tech. industry, it is going to provide much more data about the micro environments of larger populations. Ultimately this connectivity could help us better understand the relationship between the short-term/long-term environmental changes and their effects on human health. There is going to be a great opportunity for machine learning to analyze both biomonitoring  and environmental data.</p>

<p>Nowadays, we have many smart devices in-use by so many people. Data and sensor tech. companies are trying very hard to collect data from our current devices using the sensors built-in into those devices. This has led to effective solutions in some areas of applications, but also moderate outcomes in other cases or areas of applications. For example, the global position navigation system (GPS) enabled us to predict journey durations and it’s pretty accurate. On the other hand, measuring health related parameters e.g. blood pressure or sleep pattern, and heart rhythm has been recently exploited in the early detection of COVID-19 infections. Research teams and companies have tried to tell us that gathered data from smart wearables could be used in the early detection of COVID-19 viral infection before testing positive with a standard PCR test. The achieved accuracy from these studies was about 80%, which is something that needs to be carefully considered before taking this approach further. Especially when the data analysis involves complex machine learning models and statistics. Implementing those new models could end up ineffective in real world scenarios for many reasons not just due to the accuracy of the current models.</p>

<p>It may be intuitive to think that the more sensors we are able to integrate and the more parameters we will collect, the more likely these models will improve. The alternative hypothesis is that more sensors could be counterproductive, especially if there isn’t enough basic research done to understand the complexity of the measured health parameters and we might be lacking vital information about the surrounding environment. Some of the environmental parameters can already be monitored.</p> 

<p>It could also be that the current approach is to be too smart and this could lead to less good results. Therefore it is necessary to understand that the approach and results may vary from one problem to another. For example, the traffic/journey duration problem requires an accurate GPS chip hardware, enough connected devices and it’s already become a handy tool that helps a lot of people and businesses. On the contrary, early detection of a COVID-19 infection using smart wearables turned out to be a much more complex problem and we can’t immediately rely on the current wearable devices for this kind of problem. Maybe with a slight modification of the current corona-watch app, it could have been an effective app solution and a reliable feedback resource for the society. For example, by integrating a user customized COVID-19 dashboard to the corona-watch app. Anyway, the current solutions and experience confirm that these technologies are still in their infancy and there is still doubt that it will work out with current hardware technologies.</p> 

<p>With the above mentioned it is somewhat obvious that smart devices and machine learning alone are not the only key elements for the success of new sensor technologies. There are specialized applications that are gaining popularity and success and the future will unveil more of this. </p>

Let’s discuss air quality sensors in more detail. As previously mentioned, smartphone weather apps in many countries provide users with data about the air quality. I guess that some people take this data seriously and may avoid outdoor exercise when air quality is poor, others don’t check weather apps except for weather related forecasts, while others do not have access to air quality information at all. 

<p>In Egypt we have no similar access to real time monitoring data of the outdoor air quality. The smartphone weather app does not show mobile users the air quality information, at least on the built-in weather app on the ios system. While I was visiting Alexandria, I started measuring the PM2.5/10 using a cheap sensor. Interestingly, the air quality is normally good in this area because it is outside the city. It is not a crowded part of Alexandria and the oil refinery is a couple of kilometers away. In addition, the oil refinery flames are located downwind of my stay location, so the emissions are not directly coming towards us. One day, we were staying inside and the sensor started measuring drastic changes in the outdoor air quality. In the begining, not everyone has noticed the smoke. The indoor air quality gradually started to change, but because I was doing taking measurments I checked the sensor data. The PM2.5/10 did change and increased above the normal baseline (Figure below). Everyone later were afftected by the smoke as the indoor air substantially changed. Outdoor activities, especially for kids were cancelled. We tried to minimize smoke inside by adjusting ventilation cycles. I followed up on this incidence and wanted to learn about the source of this smoke. I was told by one of the neighbours that some people burn the waste pile, because the city council stopped sending trucks to collect trash. At this moment, I noticed that having a network of affordable sensors could have multiple benefits when tackling environmental problems. First, it is a surveillance tool and will enable people as well as the governments to monitor law violations and address environmental related problems. Imagine if millions of sensors in smart devices monitor air quality, we can efficiently raise awareness about the environmental challenges. It is also clear that relying on smart sensors/devices without complying to the necessary actions makes these tools fail to have useful applications. On the other hand, measuring the daily human exposure to air pollution and temperature in their microenvironments could end up to be a very valuable source of information when added to the biomonitoring data. The future of environmental sensors is promising both to research, end-users, and governments. Finally, it is important to understand the calibration of these affordable sensors, especially in humid environments and to what extent these sensors could be wisely used e.g. mapping of air quality. It looks like integrating an air quality sensor to mobile devices could bring very useful applications in the future, especially with machine learning we could build better models to understand further the interaction between human health and the environment.</p>
