<p style="text-align:justify">The PM2.5, PM10, and the Air Quality index (AQI) are measurable parameters for air pollution. The weather app on our mobile phones shows the AQI, because it is believed that the air quality both outdoor and indoor is of significant importance to our health. Air pollution is a major cause of many premature deaths and severe respiratory illness, especially in children.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">There are sensors commercially available that can be used to monitor the air quality around the clock. They are used in many countries to track air pollution levels. Since air pollution has harmful effects on our health, it is an essential matter to public health safety. Expensive instruments that measure air quality are typically installed at different sites to measure air pollution levels within cities, with special focus on industrial sites. Recently, cheap optical sensors gained some popularity and it has been shown that they could be effectively used to some degree in the real time monitoring of the air quality in the environment. They can be easily installed in remote areas, in abundant quantities, essentially everywhere, and require low operational costs. These sensors can provide big data and can keep us informed about the air quality changes in many areas.</p> 

<p style="text-align:justify">However, information about the air quality in the local environment of individuals remains largely inaccessible. This information could give mobile users useful predictions about when to go out for outdoor sport activities, as an example. I expect in the future that smaller sensors will be integrated into mobile devices. When this becomes a standard for the smart device tech. industry, it is going to provide much more data about the micro environments of larger populations. Ultimately, this connectivity could help us better understand the relationship between the short-term/long-term environmental exposures and their effects on human health. There is going to be a great opportunity for machine learning to analyze both biomonitoring  and environmental data.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Nowadays, we have many connected smart devices. Data and sensor tech. companies are trying very hard to collect data from connected devices using the built-in sensors. This has led to effective solutions in some areas of applications, but also moderate outcomes in other cases or areas of applications. For example, the global position navigation system (GPS) enabled us to predict journey durations and it’s pretty accurate. On the other hand, measuring health related parameters e.g. blood pressure or sleep pattern, and heart rhythm has been recently exploited in the early detection of COVID-19 infections. Some research teams and companies have tried to gathered data from smart wearables and find if the data could be used in the early detection of COVID-19 viral infection, even before a positive standard PCR test detects the virus. The achieved accuracy from these studies were in the range of 80%, which is something that needs to be carefully considered before taking this approach further. Especially when the data analysis involves complex machine learning models and statistics. Implementing those new models could easily end up ineffective in real world scenarios for many reasons not just due to the accuracy of the current models.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">It may be intuitive to think that the more sensors we are able to integrate and the more parameters we will collect, the more likely these models will improve. It can also be that the training data set is still small. The alternative hypothesis is that more sensors and data could be counterproductive, especially if there isn’t enough basic research done that tries first to understand the complexity of the measured health parameters and the relationship between all of the variables and the biology. It is also possible that we are lacking vital information about the surrounding environment. Some of the environmental parameters can already be monitored and may give us new understanding of these much more complex problems. It is too early to signify that any of the current approaches will work, but future research can lead to new results.</p> 

<p style="text-align:justify">It is also necessary to understand that the approach and results may vary from one problem to another. For example, the traffic and journey duration problem required an accurate GPS chip hardware, enough connected devices and it’s already became a handy tool that helps millions of people and businesses. On the contrary, early detection of a COVID-19 infection using smart wearables turned out to be a much more complex problem and we can’t immediately rely on the current devices for this kind of problem. Maybe with a slight modification of the current corona-watch app, it could have been an effective app solution and a reliable feedback and awareness resource for the society. For example, by integrating a user customized COVID-19 dashboard to the corona-watch app. Anyway, the current solutions and experience confirms that these technologies are still in their infancy and there is still doubt that it will work out with current hardware technologies.</p> 

<p style="text-align:justify">With the above mentioned it is somewhat obvious that smart devices and machine learning alone are not the only key elements for the success of new sensor technologies. There are specialized applications that are gaining popularity and success and the future will unveil more of this. </p>

Let’s discuss air quality sensors in more detail. As previously mentioned, smartphone weather apps in many countries provide users with data about the air quality. I guess that some mobile users take this data seriously and may avoid outdoor exercise when air quality is poor, other connected users maybe checking weather apps only for weather related forecasts, while others might not have access to air quality information at all. 

<p style="text-align:justify">In Egypt there is still no access to real time monitoring data of the outdoor air quality. The smartphone weather app does not provide mobile users with information about the air quality information, at least on the built-in weather app on the iOS system. While I was visiting Alexandria, I started measuring the PM2.5/10 using a cheap sensor. Interestingly, the air quality is normally good in this area because it is outside the city. It is not as crowded and the oil refinery is a couple of kilometers away. In addition, the oil refinery flames are located downwind of the measured location, so the emissions are not directly impacting the area. One day the sensor started measuring drastic changes in the outdoor air quality. In the begining, not everyone in the indoor environment has noticed the smoke. The indoor air quality gradually started to change, but the sensor data (PM2.5/10) significantly increased above the normal baseline (Figure below). Residents later were afftected by the smoke as the indoor air substantially deteriorated. Following up this incidence it turned out that some of the residents in the area started to burn the waste pile. It seems that the city council for a while has stopped sending trucks to collect trash. At this moment, it became noticeable that having a network of affordable sensors could have multiple benefits when tackling similar environmental problems. First, it is a surveillance tool and will enable people as well as the governments to monitor law violations and address environmental related problems. Maybe millions of sensors in smart devices to monitor air quality can efficiently raise awareness about the environmental challenges. It is also clear that relying on smart sensors/devices without complying to the necessary actions makes these tools fail to have useful applications.</p> 

<p>Measuring the daily human exposure to air pollution and temperature in their microenvironments could be a very valuable source of information when added to the biomonitoring data. The future of environmental sensors is promising both to research, end-users, and authoroties. It is important to understand the calibration process of these sensors, or similar future technologies, especially in humid environments and to what extent these sensors could be wisely used for e.g. mapping of air quality. It looks like integrating an air quality sensor to mobile devices could bring very useful applications in the future, especially with machine learning we might be able to build better models to understand further the interaction between human health and the environment. However, we have to always remember how these technologies and new gadgets could be effectively used in improving the quality of life.</p>
